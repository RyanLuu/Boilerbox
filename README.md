Party games played by tilting your phone. Purdue Hackers Hello World 2018


This game uses a server connection to send phone gyroscope data to the client. So you can't play it. Sorry. Maybe we'll set up a better version later. Check out the code tho, we have cool stuff.

A description of what once was here:

4 Players connect their phones to a web page. They can now use their phones like Wii motes to control games.

Games:
  Rotate - rotate your phone to match the orientation of the object on screen
  Fruit Ninja - slash across the screen to destroy fruit
  Bouncer - hold your phone sideways and tilt to move a ball to knock other players off a platform
